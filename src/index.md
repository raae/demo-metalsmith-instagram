This is a statically generated site with the latest images from my [personal Instagram account](http://instagram.com/benedicteraae).

There is no front-end code getting these photos. The image source urls and captions 
are fetched from Instagram when the site is built. The content is kept updated by building and 
deploying the site twice a day.

A tutorial will soon be published on [bgraphic.no](http://bgraphic.no)!
Get a tweet from me when it is published by tweeting ["I am interested in the Metalsmith ❤️ Instagram tutorial @raae!"](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20am%20interested%20in%20the%20Metalsmith%20%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F%20Instagram%20tutorial%20%40raae!%0A)
or something like that.
